# RS Trick Coach

The idea for the project came to me when I was training to become a rope skipping judge. As a non-active jumper, I found it difficult to quickly identify and evaluate the jumps. I then had the idea of creating a website/app where you can watch rope skipping jumps on video and enter the corresponding level of difficulty and type of judge.

The training is based on the German Gymnastics Federation (DTB) evaluation system, which is based on the IJRU's 4.0.0 rules.

This site is not a substitute for a judge training or official IJRU training; rather, it is a supplement to make it easier to learn the tricks.
