<p>The idea for the project came to me when I was training to become a rope skipping judge. As a non-active jumper, I found it difficult to quickly identify and evaluate the jumps. I then had the idea of creating a website/app where you can watch rope skipping jumps on video and enter the corresponding level of difficulty and type of judge.</p>

<p>The training is based on the German Gymnastics Federation (DTB) evaluation system, which is based on the IJRU's 4.0.0 rules.</p>

<p>This site is not a substitute for a judge training or official IJRU training; rather, it is a supplement to make it easier to learn the tricks.</p>
